= SAML Migrate Samples

This repository contains samples meant to be used as a reference for migrating from the `spring-security-saml` extension to the new `spring-security-saml2-service-provider` module in Spring Security.

These samples are intended to be compared with the samples in the Spring Security Samples repository.

Please refer to the README inside each sample for more information.
