= SAML 2.0 Login Sample

This guide provides instructions on setting up this SAML 2.0 Login sample application.
It uses https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/saml2/main/[Okta SAML 2.0 IDP] as its asserting party.

The sample application uses Spring Boot and the EOL `org.springframework.security.extensions:spring-security-saml2-core:1.0.10.RELEASE` dependency.

This sample is intended to be used as an apples-to-apples comparison with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/tree/5.7.x/servlet/spring-boot/java/saml2/login-single-tenant[SAML 2.0 Login Sample] which uses `spring-security-saml2-service-provider` module.

== Run the Sample

=== Start up the Sample Boot Application
```
 ./gradlew :bootRun
```
Or run the `LoginApplication.java` class directly.

=== Open a Browser

http://localhost:8080/

You will be redirected to the Okta SAML 2.0 IDP

=== Type in your credentials

```
User: testuser@spring.security.saml
Password: 12345678
```
